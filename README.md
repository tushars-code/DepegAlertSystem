# üõ°Ô∏è DepegAlertSystem

A high-performance C++ backend system to predict and alert on **stablecoin depeg events** using real-time price feeds, on-chain flow analytics, historical pattern detection, and risk modeling.

## Objective

The system aims to:
- Monitor stablecoin stability in **real-time**
- Identify risk factors from **price deviation, wallet flows, TVL drops, sentiment analysis**
- Match current behavior to **historical depeg patterns**
- Generate **alerts** with risk scores, confidence levels, and triggering factors
